General pointer tips for chess

Early Game: Develop Pieces

MidGame: Improve Position (this is noted by castling) 

Late Game: Queens are off


Suggestions:

1. Pieces have values. Change the values as the game progresss
Knights are worth more midgame and less late game, knights are better when the position is complicated and tight, they can 
enter spaces that bishops, rooks and queen cannot
-> piece values should change (little more drastically at different parts of the game)


Expansion: Pieces like the Bishop (blocked between) on the back rank, 
knights on the corners, they should be worth less value because they are pretty useless

2. Winning the EXCHANGE 
This is probably the most important thing. While piece values can change from game state,  Usually winning the exchange is valuable
If you have a center knight for example (it should be worth more points because it covers a lot of strong squares)
even better is a knight on an outpost( the pawns are past the knight can no longer 'kick' or attack the knight)

This knight should be worth more than the bishop!!! So it would be bad (min max) to trade this knight away!

3. When you are ahead by lots of value (multiple exchanges, passed pawn, etc) YOU SHOULD trade

By equally trading material ( for relatively the same value), you will come out ahead in the late game and it will be easier to 
convert to a win with less things on the board
